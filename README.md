PromptDesk is a versatile tool designed to facilitate the creation, organization, and evaluation of prompts and Large Language Models (LLMs). This guide will help you set up PromptDesk on your system quickly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the PromptDesk repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:promptdesk/promptdesk.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   
   Change to the newly created `promptdesk` directory:

   ```bash
   cd promptdesk
   ```

3. **Set your port numbers and configuration with environment variables**

   ```bash
   export PROMPT_SERVER_PORT=4000
   export PROMPT_FRONTEND_PORT=3000
   export DATABASE_SELECTION=mongodb
   export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/promptdesk
   export OPEN_AI_API_KEY=sk-abc123
   ```

4. **Start the Service with Docker Compose**
   
   Run Docker Compose to start the PromptDesk service:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will download the necessary Docker images and start the services in detached mode.

   After running the above commands, check the status of the Docker containers to ensure that they are up and running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

## Start Building

- Open a web browser and navigate to the application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:port`). The specific port number will be mentioned in the project documentation or Docker Compose file.

  ```bash
  http://localhost:4000
  ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start creating, organizing, and evaluating prompts and LLMs. Refer to the official [PromptDesk Documentation](https://promptdesk.ai/docs) for detailed instructions and examples.
